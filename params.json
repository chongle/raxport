{"name":"Raxport","tagline":"Export Thermo Raw files to FT1 and FT2 text files","body":"# Instructions:\r\n\r\nInstall the latest MSFileReader (v2.2 or higher) from Thermo Scientific. Freely available at http://sjsupport.thermofinnigan.com/public/detail.asp?id=703. Please check the boxes during installation to install both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of MSFileReader.\r\nDownload raxport.exe from http://code.google.com/p/raxport/downloads/list\r\nOpen a Windows console and run raxport.exe. Run \"raxport.exe --help\" to get usage:\r\nUsage: raxport.exe -w WorkingDirectory\r\n\r\n[-w WorkingDirectory]\r\nExtract all raw files in the working directory and its sub-directories. \r\nDefault: current directory\r\n\r\n[--noFT1]\r\nDo not extract FT1 files.\r\nDefault: false\r\n\r\n[--noFT2]\r\nDo not extract FT2 files.\r\nDefault: false\r\n\r\n[--help]\r\nGet help information\r\n\r\nIf no option is provided, extract both FT1 and FT2 files from the current directory\r\nThe working directory and its sub-directories contain the raw files to be exported. Raxport will export the FT1 and FT2 files to the same directory as their originating raw files. If the -w option is not provided, the working directory is defaulted to the current directory.\r\n\r\nBy default, Raxport exports both FT1 file and FT2 file from a Raw file. If FT1 files are not needed, use the --noFT1 option. If FT2 files are not needed, use the --noFT2 option.\r\n\r\nA sample Raw file and its FT1 and FT2 files are provided at http://code.google.com/p/raxport/downloads/list\r\n\r\n# Example 1:\r\n\r\nSuppose that raxport.exe is saved to C:\\proteomics_software\r\nSuppose that the raw files are in D:\\proteomics_data\\run1\r\nType the command below in a Windows console\r\nC:\\proteomics_software\\raxport.exe -w D:\\proteomics_data\\run1\r\nThis will extract FT1 and FT2 files from all raw files in D:\\proteomics_data\\run1 and all its sub-directories. FT1 and FT2 files will be saved in the same directory as the raw files.\r\n\r\n# Example 2:\r\n\r\nSuppose that raxport.exe is saved to a directory listed in the Path variable of Windows Environment Variables. Then raxport.exe can be called without providing the full path of raxport.exe.\r\nSince the working directory is default to the current directory, you can go to the working directory and run raxport.exe without using the -w option.\r\nType the command below in a Windows console to extract only FT2 files\r\ncd D:\\proteomics_data\\run1\r\nraxport.exe --noFT1\r\nFT1 File Format:\r\n\r\nS       12      12\r\nI       RetentionTime   0.03873\r\nI       ScanType        FT-MS1\r\nI       ScanFilter      FTMS + p NSI Full ms [400.00-1700.00]\r\n654.39655       628.70  12304   17.95   293.89  0\r\n660.30737       1397.14 11801   18.18   294.56  2\r\n660.80933       608.34  15304   18.20   294.62  2\r\nS line: This is scan #12.\r\nI line: Retention time is at 0.03873 minute\r\nI line: The scan type is FT-MS1\r\nI line: The filter text is \"FTMS + p NSI Full ms [400.00-1700.00]\", which means FTMS acquisition with positive nanospray ionization for full MS1 scan from 400 Da to 1700 Da\r\nData block: Each row represents a peak.

For high-resolution FT MS data, FT1 and FT2 files also extract resolution, baseline, noise, and charge, provided in the labels of peaks.\r\n\r\n## What programs is Raxport dependent on to run?\r\nRaxport is dependent on the freely available Thermo MSFileReader v2.2 or later. But it is not dependent on Xcalibur, which requires a license to install.\r\n\r\n## What operating system is supported?\r\nWe have tested Raxport on Windows XP and Windows 7. Linux is not supported, because Thermo MSFileReader is not available for Linux.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
