{"name":"Raxport","tagline":"Export Thermo Raw files to FT1 and FT2 text files","body":"# Instructions:\r\n\r\nInstall the latest MSFileReader (v2.2 or higher) from Thermo Scientific. Freely available at http://sjsupport.thermofinnigan.com/public/detail.asp?id=703. \r\n\r\nPlease check the boxes during installation to install both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of MSFileReader.\r\n\r\nDownload raxport.exe from http://code.google.com/p/raxport/downloads/list\r\n\r\nOpen a Windows console and run raxport.exe. Run \"raxport.exe --help\" to get usage:\r\n\r\n`Usage: raxport.exe -w WorkingDirectory`\r\n\r\n`[-w WorkingDirectory]`\r\n`Extract all raw files in the working directory and its sub-directories. `\r\n`Default: current directory`\r\n\r\n`[--noFT1]`\r\n`Do not extract FT1 files.`\r\n`Default: false`\r\n\r\n`[--noFT2]`\r\n`Do not extract FT2 files.`\r\n`Default: false`\r\n\r\n`[--help]`\r\n`Get help information`\r\n\r\nIf no option is provided, extract both FT1 and FT2 files from the current directory\r\n\r\nThe working directory and its sub-directories contain the raw files to be exported. Raxport will export the FT1 and FT2 files to the same directory as their originating raw files. If the -w option is not provided, the working directory is defaulted to the current directory.\r\n\r\nBy default, Raxport exports both FT1 file and FT2 file from a Raw file. If FT1 files are not needed, use the --noFT1 option. If FT2 files are not needed, use the --noFT2 option.\r\n\r\nA sample Raw file and its FT1 and FT2 files are provided at http://code.google.com/p/raxport/downloads/list\r\n\r\n# Example 1:\r\n\r\n* Suppose that raxport.exe is saved to C:\\proteomics_software\r\n* Suppose that the raw files are in D:\\proteomics_data\\run1\r\n* Type the command below in a Windows console\r\n`C:\\proteomics_software\\raxport.exe -w D:\\proteomics_data\\run1`\r\n\r\nThis will extract FT1 and FT2 files from all raw files in D:\\proteomics_data\\run1 and all its sub-directories. FT1 and FT2 files will be saved in the same directory as the raw files.\r\n\r\n# Example 2:\r\n\r\n* Suppose that raxport.exe is saved to a directory listed in the Path variable of Windows Environment Variables. Then raxport.exe can be called without providing the full path of raxport.exe.\r\n\r\n* Since the working directory is default to the current directory, you can go to the working directory and run raxport.exe without using the -w option.\r\n\r\n* Type the command below in a Windows console to extract only FT2 files\r\n\r\n`cd D:\\proteomics_data\\run1`\r\n`raxport.exe --noFT1`\r\n\r\n# FT1 File Format:\r\n\r\n`S       12      12`\r\n\r\n`I       RetentionTime   0.03873`\r\n\r\n`I       ScanType        FT-MS1`\r\n\r\n`I       ScanFilter      FTMS + p NSI Full ms [400.00-1700.00]`\r\n\r\n`654.39655       628.70  12304   17.95   293.89  0`\r\n\r\n`660.30737       1397.14 11801   18.18   294.56  2`\r\n\r\n`660.80933       608.34  15304   18.20   294.62  2`\r\n\r\n* S line: This is scan #12.\r\n* I line: Retention time is at 0.03873 minute\r\n* I line: The scan type is FT-MS1\r\n* I line: The filter text is \"FTMS + p NSI Full ms [400.00-1700.00]\", which means FTMS acquisition with positive nanospray ionization for full MS1 scan from 400 Da to 1700 Da\r\n* Data block: Each row represents a peak.

For high-resolution FT MS data, FT1 and FT2 files also extract resolution, baseline, noise, and charge, provided in the labels of peaks.\r\n\r\n## What programs is Raxport dependent on to run?\r\nRaxport is dependent on the freely available Thermo MSFileReader v2.2 or later. But it is not dependent on Xcalibur, which requires a license to install.\r\n\r\n## What operating system is supported?\r\nWe have tested Raxport on Windows XP and Windows 7. Linux is not supported, because Thermo MSFileReader is not available for Linux.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
